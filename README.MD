My personal notes about my Ubuntu environment, bash, and gnome utils.

# Dell Bios

F2


# Start X Session

Ctrl + Alt + F2


# Always on Top

"Alt + Space" bring up the system menu for the frameless window. 
Choose "Always on Top".


# Nerd Fonts

[Ubuntu Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
downloaded and `Ubuntu Nerd Font Complete.ttf` is installed.

# Networking

Update `/etc/hosts.allow` in order to allow local network access:

```
ALL: LOCAL
```
